## Status of this feature
This feature is experimental and in active development. See [Changelog section](#changelog) for details on progressive feature implementation.

## Introduction
*Summarize the problem with the current Device Mode and how this feature will help alleviate that problem*

## Goals
*Summarize the goals for this feature. What will it help developers do? What is the definition of success?*

## Non-goals
*Explicitly list out non-goals. What is out of scope? What is something we investigated but decided not to implement? What other metrics for success did we consider and why did we not choose them?*

## Hypotheses
*What hypotheses do we want to validate with user research? They should be formatted like the following:* 
- *We believe this [Concept] will solve [Problem] and be valuable to [Customers] while doing [Job-to-be-done]. We believe this [Concept] will increase/decrease [End-User Metric].*
- *We believe that [Customers] will be successful solving [Problem] using [Experience] while doing [Job-to-be-done]. We will know this to be true when we see [Success Criteria].*

*Refer to [Develop your hypothesis](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/MicrosoftSignal/SitePages/Develop-Your-Hypothesis.aspx) for more info.*

## Experimentation
*We know this feature will be shipped as an experiment in the Microsoft Edge DevTools. What should the trigger condition be for identifying treatment and control groups? How would you expect metrics to perform across treatment and control? For example, with this feature, should we see Device Mode usage go up? Does that qualify as success?*

## Usage
*This is where we'll describe how the feature will look and work. I've added some sub-sections here off the top-of-my-head but we're not married to these. As you investigate and develop this feature, we'll continue to refine this section.*

### Add a new viewport

### Open DevTools against a new viewport

### Synchronize browsing and inspection across viewports
